# Algorithmic Graph Theory

This repository contains my work during the semester, focused on implementing algorithms such as "shortest-path" using the labelset method, "kruskal-algorithm," and "critical-path-method." Each algorithm has its own folder with its own code and data.

In addition to the code and data for each algorithm, I have included a summary of the relevant theory. This summary is intended to provide a quick reference for those who may be unfamiliar with the algorithm or need a refresher on its concepts.

All code is written in Java, and to run the program, simply execute the main file.

## Algorithms Implemented

### Shortest Path

The Labelset algorithm is a shortest path algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It maintains a set of labels for each node in the graph that contains the current shortest path length from the source node to that node. The algorithm iteratively updates these labels until the shortest path to all nodes is found.

### Kruskal Algorithm

The Kruskal algorithm is a greedy algorithm used to find the minimum and the maxium spanning tree of a connected weighted graph. The algorithm operates by sorting the edges by weight, and then adding them one by one to the minimum spanning tree, provided that adding an edge does not create a cycle.

### Critical Path Method (CPM)

The Critical Path Method (CPM) is a project management algorithm used to plan and manage complex projects. It utilizes a network diagram to represent the project activities, their durations, and their dependencies. CPM identifies the critical path of a project, which is the sequence of activities that determine the total duration of the project.

## Running the programs

To run the program, simply execute the main file in the root directory. All necessary dependencies are included.

If you find a bug or would like to suggest an improvement, feel free to submit a pull request. I would love to see this project grow and improve over time.
